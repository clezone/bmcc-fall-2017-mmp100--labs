      <H1> Aventura </h1>
        <ul>
<li> Aventura was a Dominican bachata group from the bronx. They started in the year 1993 and formed by Anthony "Romeo Santos", Henry Santos, Lenny Santos, and Max Santos. There music connects with people that have gone through a break ups. </li>
</ul>
      <p> Aventura is one of my favorite group because ever since I was little my parents used to play there songs every saturday morning. It got to the point where almost all there songs got stuck to my head. Now each time I hear one of their songs it reminds me of those saturday mornings.
